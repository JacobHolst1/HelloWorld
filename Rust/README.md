# Overview

This program allows a user to write, store, and read passwords using text files. It also has a password generator, which will provide the user with a password of a specified length and complexity.

I thought this project would be good for learning the basics of using primitive types in Rust. After my last project in C++, I wanted to keep things a bit more simple to make sure I could effectively build the program one step at a time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This project was all written using VS Code.

The code is all written in Rust, with some .txt files for storing passwords.
