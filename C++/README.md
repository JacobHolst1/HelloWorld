# Overview

This software is a basic version of chess. It includes full functionality for each chess piece, including castling and en passant captures. The gui is all console-based, so the project is more focused on the functionality of the game rather than the full scope of making a game.

Of the programming languages that I haven't previously had experience with, C++ is by far the one I've heard the most about. So I wanted to make a program that would take enough time and effort to elicit a decently good understanding of how the language works. By way of learning, I'd say that I was very successful with my goal.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to edit and write the program. I followed the pop-up instructions that show up when you make a new C++ file without having a compiler installed already.

The program is written using C++. The libraries involved include std namespace, iostream, stdio.h, iomanip, dequeue, vector, string, fstream, and chrono.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- First thing I need to do is finish figuring out how to get my compiler to run multiple files at once. From what I can tell, this is the main reason I couldn't get my program to run in the end.
- Once the main code runs, I would like to incorporate the feature to save and load games.
- The final step to making this project really feel complete for me would be to add to the code to make a more sophisticated GUI for the game.
