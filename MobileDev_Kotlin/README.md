# Overview

This is my starting project for learning mobile development. I got started with exploring Android Studio, and later followed a series of tutorial videos to put together a task manager mobile app. My original intent was to primarily use Kotlin, but I ended up focusing more on
xml and Java.

The app is still incomplete, but so far it has multiple screens. There are three screens: a display for when the app opens,
the main interface, and the list of tasks.

This software is designed to keep a running to-do list.

Here's a link to my YouTube demo:

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop the application. 

The code consists of files in Kotlin, Java, and xml.

# Useful Websites

I primarily used W3Schools and Kotlin's website to learn the language. I referred to a
YouTube tutorial to work out parts of the project that I couldn't figure out as a beginner.
