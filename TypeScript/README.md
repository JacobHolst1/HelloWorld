# Overview

This is my project for learning TypeScript. It takes a two text entries (one as a title, the other as the entry) and makes
a note card with an id, title, and date of creation.

My initial design for it was to be a basic interface for a user to write
a short note, store it into a text file using arrays, and then load the file for viewing and editing. As I began learning
about TypeScript, I thought it better to focus on implementing TypeScript into front-end design. 


Here's a link to my YouTube demo:

# Development Environment

I wrote everything in Visual Studio Code.

It is primarily written using TypeScript and HTML with a touch of CSS. Most of the TypeScript is saved as .tsx files to acommodate jsx functionality.

# Useful Websites

These sites helped me in learning a lot of the code for this project:

- [TypeScript in w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript)
- [TypeScript Language Site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [DOM Manipulation Guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/dom-manipulation.html)
- [JSX Guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html)
- [YouTube Tutorial on Types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs)


#Future Work

I want to continue work on this project to make it more visually appealing and user friendly. This includes:
-Let the user save the notecards so they can leave the page and the cards will still be there when they return.
-Add another textbox to let the user add a category to the notes they are making. Have the program store the categories
and be able to sort them by category.
-Implement a nav that adds items to it as new categories come up. As the user selects an item in the nav, it will bring
up all the notes of the specified category.
