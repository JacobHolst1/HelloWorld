# Overview

This is my project for learning Java.

It's a basic interface for a social media platform or other website, 
designed for users to log in and have their data stored.

I chose this project because I thought it would be good for helping me
learn basics with input/output and file writing using
Java.

Here's a link to my YouTube demo:

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to download Java (using Eclipse), write the code, and run the code.
This project is written in Java with data storage being currenlty recorded on .txt files.
Libraries I used include java.io.File, java.io.Scanner, java.util.Arrays, and java.util.Calendar

#Future Work

- I still need to fix the files to write more smoothly
